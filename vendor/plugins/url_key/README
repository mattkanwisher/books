= UrlKey

The UrlKey module creates an unchanging permalink identifier for a model 
object.

It is like Rick Olson's {PermalinkFu plugin}[http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/permalink_fu/]
with a couple of changes:

1. URL keys are guaranteed to be unique by appending of a count.
2. URL keys are only generated on create, so they never change

== Using UrlKey

Install the plugin with:

  script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/slantwise/url_key/trunk url_key

In your linkable models, include the following:

  class Thingy < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_url_key :title
  end

This assumes you have a column called +url_key+ defined in your model. If 
your field is named differently, you can specify it like this:

  class Thingy < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_url_key :title, :permalink
  end

When a record is created, a unique url_key based on the :title column will 
automatically be created.
